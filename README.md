```python
# Example scene graph output
Scene: "There is a person in the scene."
Obstacle: "Person detected ahead - be careful"
Scene Graph: {
    "entities": ["person"],
    "relationships": ["person -> ahead"],
    "importance": 0.95,
    "timestamp": 1234567890
}
```

### Intelligent Obstacle Detection
1. **Person Detection** (Highest Priority): "Person detected ahead - be careful"
2. **Large Object Detection**: "Large object detected ahead"
3. **Small Object Detection**: "Small object detected ahead"
4. **Motion Detection**: "Moving object detected ahead"
5. **Dark Object Detection**: "Dark object detected ahead"

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Modules
- **PathManager**: Visual odometry-based path recording and navigation
- **LLMNavigator**: AI-powered navigation with TTS and fallback logic
- **SceneGraph**: Advanced scene understanding and object relationship mapping
- **CameraProcessor**: Real-time camera feed processing with object detection
- **GUI**: Modern Tkinter-based user interface with scene graph integration

### Data Flow
```
Camera Feed → Object Detection → Scene Graph → Navigation Logic → TTS Voice Guidance
     ↓              ↓                ↓              ↓                ↓
